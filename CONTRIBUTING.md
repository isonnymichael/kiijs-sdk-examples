# ü§ù Contributing to KiiJS SDK Example Apps

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project welcomes any pull requests, issues, or suggestions to improve the examples and documentation.

## üì¶ About the Project

This repository contains a collection of simple and practical example applications built with React + Vite to demonstrate how to use the [KiiJS SDK](https://github.com/KiiChain/kiijs-sdk) in real-world scenarios.

Each folder (e.g. `example-1`, `example-2`) is a standalone project using the KiiJS SDK.

## üß∞ Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- pnpm / npm / yarn (choose one)

### Run a single example app

1. Navigate to the example folder, e.g. `example-1`
2. Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
3. Start the dev server using `pnpm dev`

Repeat these steps for any example app (`example-X`).

## üè∑Ô∏è Understanding Labels

We use GitHub labels to organize contributions:

- `bug`: Fixes an error or broken functionality.
- `enhancement`: Improves an existing feature or code.
- `feature`: Introduces new functionality.
- `good first issue`: Great for first-time contributors.
- `help wanted`: Contributions are welcome.
- `question`: Open-ended discussions or clarifications.

---

## üßº Code Quality

We use **ESLint** and **Prettier** to ensure consistent code formatting. Before committing:

```bash
   npm run lint
```

Linting and formatting will also run automatically on staged files using **Husky** and **lint-staged**.
